# JD Visuals Source

This directory contains the source files of the core visualization engine. The primary unit is `JD.Visuals.pas` where you find the main thread, custom control, base visual object, and otherwise general implementation of the visuals.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This particular branch is aimed at changing the system to use DWScript to power dynamic visuals.
